# Ideas
+  desktop based multi-lang ide to write and maintain random code.
    + kind of maintains code like github;s gist but on desktop locally and also provides ability to run the code without user needing to install the language.
    + could use docker behind the scenes or a runner web-service.
    + tech-stack for windows could be [UWP](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/get-started/universal-application-platform-guide) or MFC apps.
    + for backend, depends, if on local, docker image is the best bet of achieving non-installation run for a lanugage.

# Why the repo?
takeaway from repo - good learning projects that students can create to get their hands dirty on. These are just ideas like when people create instagram or facebook for learning purpose -- you can as well get yours hands dirty by starting some ideas here. learnings and takeaways won't be much different when you start understanding and reading about how systems work.

# philosophy
at the end of the day, software is nothing but a bunch of system calls. all 0s and 1s which are given a meaning by geeks like us. saas too is nothing but a bunch of network calls of varying nature transfering those 0s and 1s from my system to amazon's system and creating a data entry (changing the world :)).
